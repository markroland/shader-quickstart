# Shader Quickstart using Node, GLSL and Webpack

This project uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) with [GLSLify](https://github.com/glslify/glslify)
and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to compile and serve an OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)
shader using WebGL.

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npx webpack serve
```

If ./dist/bundle.js returns a 404, then you may need to run `npx webpack` first.
